# Text-Mining-Project
Class - CS105

In this project, we will be taking transcripts from YouTube videos and building a text-mining program that will summarize video descriptions and tell us what car they are working on in that video.
We will also later try to, if time permits, to create a second classification model that will also tell us the color of the car that they are working on.
